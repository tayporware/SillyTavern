# SillyTavern
## Based on a fork of TavernAI 1.2.8
### Brought to you by Cohee and RossAscends

NOTE: We have added [a FAQ](faq.md) to answer most of your questions and help you get started.

### What is SillyTavern or TavernAI?
Tavern is a user interface you can install on your computer (and Android phones) that allows you to interact with text generation AIs and chat/roleplay with characters you or the community create.

SillyTavern is a fork of TavernAI 1.2.8 which is under more active development and has added many major features. At this point, they can be thought of as completely independent programs.

### What do I need other than Tavern?
On its own Tavern is useless, as it's just a user interface. You have to have access to an AI system backend that can act as the roleplay character. There are various supported backends: OpenAPI API (GPT), KoboldAI (either running locally or on Google Colab), and more. You can read more about this in [the FAQ](faq.md).

### Do I need a powerful PC to run Tavern?
Since Tavern is only a user interface, it has tiny hardware requirements, it will run on anything. It's the AI system backend that needs to be powerful.

### I want to try self-hosted easily. Got a Google Colab?

Try on Colab (runs KoboldAI backend and TavernAI Extras server alongside):  <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Cohee1207/SillyTavern/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb">

## Installation

*NOTE: This branch is intended for local install purposes, and has not been thoroughly tested on a colab or other cloud notebook service.*

### Windows
  1. install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (latest LTS version is recommended)
  2. download the zip from this GitHub repo
  3. unzip it into a folder of your choice
  4. run start.bat via double-clicking or in a command line.
  5. Once the server has prepared everything for you, it will open a tab in your browser.

### Linux
  1. Run the `start.sh` script.
  2. Enjoy.

## Remote connections

Most often this is for people who want to use SillyTavern on their mobile phones while at home.
If you want to enable other devices to connect to your TAI server, open 'config.conf' in a text editor, and change: 

```
const whitelistMode = true;
```
to 
```
const whitelistMode = false;
```
Save the file. 
Restart your TAI server. 

You will now be able to connect from other devices.

### Managing whitelisted IPs

You can add or remove whitelisted IPs by editing the `whitelist` array in `config.conf`. You can also provide a `whitelist.txt` file in the same directory as `config.conf` with one IP address per line like:

```txt
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.2
```

The `whitelist` array in `config.conf` will be ignored if `whitelist.txt` exists.

***Disclaimer: Anyone else who knows your IP address and TAI port number will be able to connect as well***

To connect over wifi you'll need your PC's local wifi IP address 
  - (For Windows: windows button > type 'cmd.exe' in the search bar> type 'ipconfig' in the console, hit Enter > "IPv4" listing)
if you want other people on the internet to connect, check [here](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) for 'IPv4'

### Still Unable To Connect?
- Create an inbound/outbound firewall rule for the port found in `config.conf`. Do NOT mistake this for portforwarding on your router, otherwise someone could find your chat logs and that's a big no-no.
- Enable the Private Network profile type in Settings > Network and Internet > Ethernet. This is VERY important for Windows 11, otherwise you would be unable to connect even with the aforementioned firewall rules.

## Performance issues?

Try enabling the No Blur Effect (Fast UI) mode on the User settings panel.
